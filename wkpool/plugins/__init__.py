"""Feature plugins: how users add their own information to the model.

A plugin is any object with:
    name: str                       — key in weights.yaml `plugin_weights`
    adjustments(teams, weights)     — dict[team, rating_points]

Positive points strengthen a team, negative weaken it. The engine sums
weight * points over all plugins onto each team's Elo rating before
prediction and simulation, so a plugin shifts both match probabilities and
tournament odds coherently.

To add your own: drop a .py file in plugins_user/ at the repo root defining
PLUGIN (an instance), and give its name a weight in weights.yaml.
